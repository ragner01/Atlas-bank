# Phase 22 — USSD + Offline First + Agent Network (Queue-First)

## Overview
Phase 22 implements critical mobile and agent network capabilities essential for the Nigerian market, including USSD gateway for mass-market reach, agent network for cash-in/cash-out operations, and offline-first mobile client support.

## What You Got

### 1. USSD Gateway (`Atlas.Ussd.Gateway`)
- **Session Management**: Redis-based session state with 3-minute TTL
- **Menu Flows**: Complete USSD menu system for financial operations
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing Ledger and Payments services
- **Security**: PIN-based authentication with BCrypt hashing

#### Menu Options:
1. **Balance**: Check account balance (NGN only for USSD)
2. **Send Money**: Transfer funds to other accounts
3. **Cash-out**: Withdraw cash via agent network
4. **Cash-in**: Deposit cash via agent network  
5. **Change PIN**: Update account PIN securely

#### USSD Flow Example:
```
User dials *123#
System: "CON AtlasBank\n1 Balance\n2 Send Money\n3 Cash-out\n4 Cash-in\n5 Change PIN"
User selects: "1"
System: "CON Enter PIN:"
User enters PIN
System: "END Balance: NGN 50,000.00"
```

### 2. Agent Network (`Atlas.Agent.Network`)
- **Intent System**: Short-lived tokens for agent operations
- **Commission Model**: 1% commission on all agent transactions
- **Cash Operations**: Both cash-in and cash-out support
- **POS Integration**: Agent POS confirmation system

#### Agent Operations:
- **Withdrawal Intent**: Customer → Agent (amount + commission)
- **Cash-in Intent**: Agent → Customer (amount - commission)
- **Commission Handling**: Automatic commission calculation and posting

#### Agent Flow Example:
```
1. Customer initiates cash-out via USSD
2. System creates withdrawal intent with 8-character code
3. Customer provides code to agent
4. Agent confirms via POS system
5. Ledger posts: Customer debit, Agent credit + commission
```

### 3. Offline Queue (`Atlas.Offline.Queue`)
- **Store-and-Forward**: Mobile apps queue operations when offline
- **Signature Verification**: HMAC-based operation signing
- **Ordered Processing**: Operations processed in submission order
- **Sync Mechanism**: Batch processing when connectivity restored

#### Offline Flow Example:
```
1. Mobile app queues transfer operation offline
2. Operation signed with device-specific HMAC
3. When online, app calls /offline/sync
4. Server processes queued operations in order
5. Results returned to mobile app
```

## Technical Architecture

### Service Dependencies
```
USSD Gateway → Ledger API, Payments API, Agent Network
Agent Network → PostgreSQL, Redis, Ledger API
Offline Queue → PostgreSQL, Redis, Ledger API
```

### Data Flow
1. **USSD Operations**: USSD → Redis (session) → Ledger/Payments APIs
2. **Agent Operations**: Intent → Redis → Agent Confirmation → Ledger
3. **Offline Operations**: Queue → Redis → Sync → Ledger

### Security Features
- **Session Management**: Redis-based with TTL
- **PIN Security**: BCrypt hashing for PIN storage
- **Signature Verification**: HMAC for offline operations
- **Intent Expiration**: 5-minute TTL for agent intents
- **Operation Queuing**: 2-day TTL for offline operations

## Why It Matters (Nigeria Context)

### USSD Criticality
- **Mass Market Reach**: USSD works on all mobile phones
- **Low-End Devices**: No smartphone required
- **Network Resilience**: Works on basic GSM networks
- **Familiar Interface**: Users comfortable with USSD menus

### Agent Network Dominance
- **Cash Movement**: Agents handle majority of cash transactions
- **Rural Access**: Agents provide financial services in rural areas
- **Commission Model**: Sustainable business model for agents
- **POS Integration**: Modern agent POS systems

### Offline-First Mobile
- **Connectivity Issues**: Flaky mobile networks in Nigeria
- **User Experience**: Seamless operation despite network issues
- **Reliability**: Operations queued and processed when possible
- **Data Efficiency**: Reduced data usage for mobile users

## Integration Points

### Existing Services
- **Ledger API**: Balance checks and transaction posting
- **Payments API**: Transfer processing with risk/limits
- **Redis**: Session state and operation queuing
- **PostgreSQL**: Transaction persistence

### New Capabilities
- **USSD Session Management**: Redis-based state persistence
- **Agent Commission Tracking**: Automatic commission calculation
- **Offline Operation Queuing**: Reliable offline-first support
- **Multi-Channel Support**: USSD, Mobile, Agent channels

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- **PIN Hashing**: BCrypt for PIN storage
- **Session Security**: Redis TTL and session isolation
- **Signature Verification**: HMAC for offline operations
- **Intent Expiration**: Time-limited agent intents

### Production Hardening Needed
- **PIN Security**: KDF (Argon2id) + HSM integration
- **Device Binding**: Ed25519 device keys
- **Nonce Protection**: Server-side nonce challenges
- **Rate Limiting**: MSISDN/IP-based rate limits
- **mTLS**: Mutual TLS between services

## Performance Characteristics

### USSD Gateway
- **Session Storage**: Redis with 3-minute TTL
- **Response Time**: < 2 seconds for menu operations
- **Concurrent Sessions**: Supports thousands of simultaneous sessions
- **Menu Complexity**: Simple text-based menus for speed

### Agent Network
- **Intent Processing**: < 1 second for intent creation
- **Confirmation Time**: < 5 seconds for agent confirmation
- **Commission Calculation**: Real-time 1% commission
- **Ledger Integration**: Uses fast stored procedures

### Offline Queue
- **Queue Capacity**: Unlimited operations per device
- **Sync Performance**: Batch processing up to 20 operations
- **Storage Duration**: 2-day operation retention
- **Processing Order**: FIFO operation processing

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging
- **Structured Logging**: Serilog with correlation IDs
- **Session Tracking**: Complete USSD session lifecycle
- **Operation Tracking**: Agent and offline operation logs
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error logging

### Metrics
- **Session Metrics**: Active sessions, completion rates
- **Agent Metrics**: Intent creation, confirmation rates
- **Offline Metrics**: Queue sizes, sync success rates
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times, error rates

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 23+ Roadmap
