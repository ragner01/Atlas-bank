# Phase 17 â€” Trust Intelligence Layer (What Nigerian Fintechs Lack)

## Why it matters ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬
Most fintechs focus on speed & convenience but **lack trust instrumentation** â€” both internally and publicly.
- Customers can't *see* how reliable merchants or devices are.
- Regulators can't *measure* ecosystem risk in real time.
- Fraud or poor experience doesn't feedback into the product.

**AtlasBank fixes that:**
- A **Trust API** that scores every actor using *behavioral, graph,* and *community feedback* signals.
- A **Transparency Digest** that cryptographically proves data hasn't been tampered with (hash-chain anchored from Audit).
- **Community trust graph** integrating disputes, ratings, and peer interactions.

## Core features
| Layer | Signal | Purpose |
|-------|---------|----------|
| Behavior | Transaction reliability | penalize frequent fails/reversals |
| Graph | Neo4j connections | detect isolation or collusion |
| Feedback | Redis weighted average | crowd-based trust score |
| Transparency | Audit Merkle root | provable data integrity |

## Why Nigerian fintechs don't have it
- No unified feedback/trust score visible to users.
- No cross-merchant behavior graph (everyone works in isolation).
- No on-chain/off-chain transparency digest.
- No open API for regulators or users to verify transaction immutability.

## What this gives you
- **Regulatory goodwill**: verifiable audit trails and live risk dashboards.
- **User confidence**: visible trust badges per merchant.
- **Ecosystem health**: detect clusters of bad devices/IPs.
- **Foundation for open-finance reputation network**.

## Future ideas
- Feed trust scores into **risk engine** (Phase 11) for adaptive fraud rules.
- Expose public "Verified Merchant" portal.
- Publish weekly **Trust Transparency Report** anchored on blockchain.
