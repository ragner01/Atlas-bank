## Technical Implementation Details

### Resilience Patterns
```csharp
// Circuit breaker with configurable thresholds
builder.Services.AddResilience(options =>
{
    options.CircuitBreakerFailureThreshold = 5;
    options.CircuitBreakerDurationOfBreakSeconds = 30;
    options.RetryCount = 3;
    options.RetryDelayMs = 1000;
    options.TimeoutSeconds = 30;
    options.BulkheadMaxConcurrency = 10;
    options.BulkheadMaxQueuedActions = 20;
});
```

### Database Optimization
```sql
-- Enhanced indexes for performance
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS ix_accounts_tenant_currency 
ON accounts(tenant_id, currency) 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL;

-- Partial indexes for active records
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS ix_accounts_active_tenant 
ON accounts(tenant_id) 
WHERE deleted_at IS NULL AND status = 'ACTIVE';
```

### Multi-stage Docker Builds
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:9.0-alpine AS build
# ... build steps

# Stage 2: Security Scan
FROM aquasec/trivy:latest AS security-scan
# ... security scanning

# Stage 3: Runtime
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:9.0-alpine AS runtime
# ... optimized runtime
```
