# Phase 15: Cards & Tokenization Boundary - Working Demonstration

## Overview
Phase 15 successfully implements a PCI-compliant card tokenization and authorization system with the following components:

### ‚úÖ Working Components

#### 1. Cards Vault (PCI CDE) - Port 5600
- **Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Function**: Tokenizes PANs and authorizes card transactions
- **Security**: PANs encrypted with AEAD AES-GCM, stored with per-card DEK wrapped by HSM KEK

**Test Results**:
```bash
# Tokenization Test
curl -X POST http://localhost:5600/vault/tokenize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"pan":"4111111111111111","expiryMonth":12,"expiryYear":2025,"bin":"411111","last4":"1111","network":"VISA"}'

# Response: {"cardToken":"2196553631873980","bin":"411111","last4":"1111","network":"VISA","status":"active"}

# Authorization Test  
curl -X POST http://localhost:5600/vault/authorize \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"cardToken":"2196553631873980","amountMinor":5000,"currency":"USD","merchantId":"merchant123","mcc":"5411","cvv":"123"}'

# Response: {"approved":true,"auth_code":"A43F06","rrn":"E36204EA7567","network":"VISA","last4":"1111"}
```

#### 2. NetworkSim (PCI CDE) - Port 5601
- **Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Function**: Simulates external network authorization
- **Rules**: Declines high amounts, expired cards, restricted MCCs

**Test Results**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5601/net/auth \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"pan":"4111111111111111","exp_m":"12","exp_y":"2025","amount_minor":5000,"currency":"USD","merchant_id":"merchant123","mcc":"5411","cvv":"123"}'

# Response: {"approved":true,"auth_code":"A2B6CB","rrn":"609D746ED7E0","reason":"approved"}
```

#### 3. Database Schema
- **Status**: ‚úÖ WORKING
- **Cards Table**: Properly created with encrypted PAN storage
- **Test Data**: Available for testing

**Schema Verification**:
```sql
-- Cards table structure
\d cards
-- Shows: card_token, dek_id, pan_ct, aad, bin, last4, network, exp_m, exp_y, status, created_at

-- Test data verification
SELECT card_token, bin, last4, network, status FROM cards LIMIT 3;
```

### üîß Components with Issues

#### 1. Ledger API - Port 5181
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY WORKING
- **Issue**: Fast-transfer endpoint has validation bug
- **Root Cause**: Missing IdempotencyKey property in FastTransferRequest model
- **Workaround**: Direct database testing shows stored procedures work correctly

**Direct Database Test**:
```sql
-- This works correctly
SELECT sp_idem_transfer_execute('test-key-123', 'tnt_demo', 'acc_A', 'acc_B', 1000, 'NGN', 'Test transfer');
```

#### 2. Payments API - Port 5000
- **Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIALLY WORKING
- **Issue**: gRPC connection to Ledger API failing
- **Root Cause**: Ledger API endpoint issues preventing gRPC communication
- **Workaround**: Individual components work when tested separately

### üèóÔ∏è Architecture Verification

#### Security Boundaries
- ‚úÖ **PCI CDE Isolation**: Cards Vault and NetworkSim are properly isolated
- ‚úÖ **PAN Encryption**: PANs encrypted with AES-GCM before storage
- ‚úÖ **Token Format**: FPT-style tokens that are non-reversible
- ‚úÖ **Network Segmentation**: Services on private network with proper firewall rules

#### Data Flow
1. ‚úÖ **Tokenization**: PAN ‚Üí Card Token (Cards Vault)
2. ‚úÖ **Authorization**: Card Token ‚Üí Auth Decision (Cards Vault + NetworkSim)
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Ledger Posting**: Auth Decision ‚Üí Ledger Entry (Payments API ‚Üí Ledger API)

### üß™ Test Commands

#### Complete Test Sequence
```bash
# 1. Start all services
docker-compose -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.yml -f infrastructure/docker/docker-compose.additions.phase15.yml up -d

# 2. Wait for services to be ready
sleep 10

# 3. Test Cards Vault tokenization
